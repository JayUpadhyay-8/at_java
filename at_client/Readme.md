Project 2 : Java Byte AtServer Operations

<span style="background-color: yellow;">Introduction:</span>

  -	In this project we were expected to Implement _getBinary(AtKey) and _put(AtKey, byte[]) method for Public , Self and Shared key in AtClientImpl.java Class.
  -	This class will be located at at_java/at_client/src/main/java/org/atsign/client/api/impl/clients/AtClientImpl.java in the github repository.
  
  
Objective:

  -	The AtServer operations are currently carried out using String. Our primary goal is to introduce functionality that will allow Java atserver actions to use bytes [] rather     than strings.
  -	 Please read the PPT to learn about our journey and how to manage this project
